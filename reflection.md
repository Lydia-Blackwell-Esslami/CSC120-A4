Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

It was really confusing until I found out that files that are the same folder can just access each other, which is pretty cool. It was also confusing until i realized that for testing, if you make an instance of an object in one file you can't actually access it in a different file. I guess the object goes out of the memory after the file is done executing? Or maybe you could access it by doing like Passenger.testpassenger? I didn't try that it just occured to me now. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

If you have a method that needs something from another class, finish doing the skeleton for that class and the class you're working on before filling out that method. Also, an Arraylist is NOT  a list. This is again in the category of things I feel like we should cover in class becuase it was really confusing and I ended up having to ask about it during class anyway. Java has a lot a weird syntax and it continues to be my opinion that like just one day dedicated to going over the different types of objects you can have and how to declare stuff and everything would be beneficial for everyone.
